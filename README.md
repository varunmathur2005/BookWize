# Book Recommender System
A Book Recommender System built using Python that suggests books based on popularity and collaborative filtering techniques. This project utilizes data from the Kaggle Book Recommendation Dataset to provide personalized book recommendations.

## **Features**
- **Popularity-Based Recommender**: Recommends books based on their popularity, calculated from the number of ratings and average rating scores.
- **Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommender**: Suggests books based on user similarity and preferences, leveraging cosine similarity to identify related books.
- **Web Interface**: An interactive web interface built using Flask to allow users to input book titles and get recommendations.
